  App Architecture

The App was build using React Native with clean Architecture.
•	Bridge is used to connect with native platform components. 
•	App relies on heavily on reusable and independent components.
•	The UI sits on a virtual DOM(Document object model) for cross-platform compatibility.
•	Modular architecture, possible of bining native codes with Javascript and Typescript.

The app is divided into three Layers.  UI Layer, Logic layer and Data Layer.

  - UI Layer

    React Native

 Layer represents all the components or UI elements that the user interacts with like buttons, popups, text, etc. The UI layer is responsible for displaying the UI elements and handling the user input.

  - Logic Layer

    Javascript or Typescript: Layer contains the business logic of the application. It is responsible for processing data, handling the application's state, and making network requests. The logic layer is where most of the app's functional code resides.

  - Data Layer 

    Firebase database, APIs, local storage, or the device's file system.

By dividing the Educmr app into these three layers,  the code is organized in a clean and easily scalable way. Each layer has a specific responsibility and can be developed and tested separately from the others. This makes it easier to maintain and modify the app over time.
